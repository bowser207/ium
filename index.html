        <p>And now, AsapSCIENCE presents
            The elements of the Periodic Table
            There's Hydrogen and Helium
            Then Lithium, Beryllium
            Boron, Carbon everywhere
            Nitrogen all through the air
            With Oxygen so you can breathe
            And Fluorine for your pretty teeth
            Neon to light up the signs
            Sodium for salty times
            (Magnesium) Aluminum and Silicon
            (Phosphorus, then Sulfur) Chlorine and Argon
            (Potassium) And Calcium so you'll grow strong
            (Scandium) Titanium, Vanadium and Chromium and Manganese
            This is the Periodic Table
            Noble gas is stable
            Halogens and Alkali react aggressively
            Each period will see new outer shells
            While electrons are added moving to the right
            Iron is the 26th
            Then Cobalt, Nickel coins you get
            Copper, Zinc and Gallium
            Germanium and Arsenic
            Selenium and Bromine film
            While Krypton helps light up your room
            Rubidium and Strontium then Yttrium, Zirconium
            (Niobium) Molybdenum, Technetium
            (Ruthenium) Rhodium, Palladium
            (Silver-war) Then Cadmium and Indium
            (Tin-cans) Antimony then Tellurium and Iodine and Xenon
            And then Caesium and
            Barium is 56, and this is where the table splits
            Where Lanthanides have just begun
            Lanthanum, Cerium and Praseodymium
            Neodymium's next to
            Promethium, then 62's
            Samarium, Europium, Gadolinium and Terbium
            Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium, Thulium
            Ytterbium, Lutetium
            Hafnium, Tantalum, Tungsten then we're on to
            Rhenium, Osmium and Iridium
            Platinum, Gold to make you rich till you grow old
            Mercury to tell you when it's really cold
            (Thallium) And lead then Bismuth for your tummy
            (Polonium) Astatine would not be yummy
            (Radon) Francium will last a little time
            (Radium) then Actinides at 89
            This is the Periodic Table
            Noble gas is stable
            Halogens and Alkali react aggressively
            Each period will see new outer shells
            While electrons are to the right
            Actinium, Thorium, Protactinium
            Uranium, Neptunium, Plutonium
            Americium, Curium, Berkelium
            Californium, Einsteinium, Fermium
            Mendelevium, Nobelium, Lawrencium
            Rutherfordium, Dubnium, Seaborgium
            Bohrium, Hassium then Meitnerium
            Darmstadtium, Roentgenium, Copernicium
            Nihonium, Flerovium
            Moscovium, Livermorium
            Tennessine and Oganesson
            And then we're done</p>
